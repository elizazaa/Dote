Motivation
Effective communication is crucial for the success of relationships, yet many individuals struggle to convey their true emotions, especially through text messages. Our friends and ourselves have faced challenges as "bad texters." Many people are unaware of the underlying tones their text messages may convey and find it difficult to authentically express their emotions through texting compared to face-to-face interactions. As a result, many do not progress past the “talking stage.”

To address these issues, we propose Dote - an app designed to enhance users' love lives by providing personalized text replies, date suggestions, and gift recommendations based on their partner's personality traits and the context of their relationship.

Aim
We aim to help users navigate the complexities of modern romance and create more long-lasting, healthy relationships by offering personalized recommendations and guidance.

User Stories
Our primary target audience consists of individuals in committed relationships, including those in marriages or with life partners. Communication is vital for sustaining healthy partnerships, and 65% of divorces cite 'Communication Problems' as a primary cause.
Our app provides spontaneous suggestions for activities to enjoy with their partners, fostering greater intimacy and connection in their relationships.
